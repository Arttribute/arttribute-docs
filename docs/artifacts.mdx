# Artifacts

## What is an Arttribute Arifact?

An Artifact is a fundamental concept within Arttribute. It represents a piece of artwork, whether it's a painting, digital illustration, or any other form of artistic creation that can be made digitally accessible. Arttribute Items serve as the core units for artists and creators.

Key features of an Artifact include:

<!-- Table of artifact attributes -->

| Feature       | Description                                         |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`          | Unique Identifier of an artifact.                   |
| `creatorId`   | ID of the user who created this artifact.           |
| `name`        | Name of the artifact.                               |
| `description` | A brief description of the artifact.                |
| `asset`       | Data URL of the artifact's digital asset.           |
| `imageUrl`    | Public URL of the artifact's image.                 |
| `created`     | When the artifact was created (ISO 8601 timestamp). |

## Creating an Artifact

### Step 1: Prepare the Artifact Data

Before creating an artifact, gather all necessary information, including the asset data, name, and description.

### Step 2: Make API request

With the artifact data ready, you can begin the artifact creation process. Below are code snippets illustrating how to structure your API request.

:::tip
Prompt the user to sign a message with an onchain identity like a web3 wallet. This process authenticates the user and generates an access token that your application can use for subsequent requests.
