## What is an Arttribute Account?

An Arttribute Account a personal profile that allows you to access features and and content that are not available to anonymous users, such as:

- **Uploading and Managing your Art:** Once you have created an Arttribute Account, you can start uploading your art to the platform. Arttribute supports a variety of image file formats, so you can upload your art in the format that is most convenient for you. You can add tags and descriptions, and organize your art into collections.
- **Creating Collections of your Art:** Collections are a great way to organize and showcase your art. You can create collections based on theme, medium, or any other criteria that you choose.
- **Monetizing your Art:** You can also put a price on your art, allowing you to earn from it. Other users would then pay to use your.

## How to create an Arttribute Account

### Step 1: Install a compatible Web3 Wallet

A Web3 wallet is a digital wallet that allows you to interact with decentralized applications (DApps) and blockchain networks. To create an Arttribute Account, you will need to install a Web3 wallet that is compatible with the Celo network.

There are many different Web3 wallets available, such as MetaMask, CeloExtensionWallet, Valora, and CeloWallet.app. We would recommend MetaMask as it is friendly and the most widely used.

You can install the one you chose using the links below:

**MetaMask:** [https://metamask.io](https://metamask.io/)  
**CeloExtensionWallet:** [https://chrome.google.com/webstore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/celoextensionwallet/kkilomkmpmkbdnfelcpgckmpcaemjcdh)  
**Valora:** [https://valoraapp.com](https://valoraapp.com/)  
**CeloWallet.app:** [https://celowallet.app](https://celowallet.app/)

### Step 2: Sign an account creation message

Once you have installed a compatible Web3 wallet, you need to sign an account creation message. This message is used to verify your identity and create your Arttribute Account.

To sign an account creation message, you can use your Web3 wallet or a library such as ethers.js. If you are using a library such as ethers.js, you will need to provide the library with your private key.

### Step 3: Done

Once you have signed the account creation message, your Arttribute Account will be created. You can now start using Arttribute to upload and manage your art, create collections, and attribute your art when it is used by other AI platforms and services.
