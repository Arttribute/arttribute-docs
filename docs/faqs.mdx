# FAQs

Welcome to the Arttribute FAQ page! Here you'll find answers to commonly asked questions about the Arttribute platform, its services, and how it works.

## General Questions

### **1. What is Arttribute?**

Arttribute is a platform that empowers artists by offering ethical and transparent opportunities for their artwork to be used in generative AI models. Artists can showcase their work, set usage prices, and maintain ownership, while AI developers can responsibly source and attribute art.

### **2. How does Arttribute differ from other art platforms?**

Unlike traditional art platforms, Arttribute integrates the decentralized web, offering programmatically enforceable licenses and tamper-proof certificates. This ensures artists are compensated fairly and their works are used ethically.

## For Artists

### **3. How do I get compensated?**

You will first need to specify the price of your artwork. Whenever someone uses your artwork, they make a payment based on the price you've set. Arttribute ensures seamless and secure transactions, transferring funds directly to your linked account.

## For AI Practitioners

### **4. What are Permission Requests?**

Permission requests are typically used when a user wants to acquire rights to use an item or collection that requires explicit permission from the owner.

### **5. What are Arttribute Certificates?**

Arttribute Certificates are tamper-proof digital certificates that serve as proof of proper rights acquisition for artwork. They are verifiale proof that you have the necessary permissions to use a particular piece of art.

## Licensing

### **6. Can I customize my licensing terms?**

No. Arttribute is developing a set of standardized CC-like code-enforceable licenses. In the meantime, CC licenses will be used for items within Arttribute. If the owner of the artwork wishes to specify additional terms, they can do so by making permission requests mandatory for their items. This allows the artist to specify terms which a user can then agree to when sending a permission request.

### **7. What are CC-Like Licenses powered by code?**

Drawing inspiration from Creative Commons (CC) licenses, Arttribute is developing code-enforced licenses. Unlike traditional symbols, these licenses are programmatically enforceable, ensuring transparency and adherence to usage terms.
