# Code-Enforceable Licenses

## What are Arttribute Licenses?

Inspired by Creative Commons, Arttribute licenses are designed to provide a simple standard way to grant permissions for the use of your work in AI-driven creative processes - ensuring that you are always credited for your work.

There are four types of licenses:

### Arttribute Open License

This license permits the use of art in AI-driven creative processes where the resultant output can be distributed or modified as long as an attribution to the original creator of the art is provided. The license allows for commercial use of the resultant output.

### Arttribute Exclusive License

This license permits the use of art exclusively by any agreed number of parties in AI-driven creative processes. The resultant output can be distributed or modified, including for commercial purposes, as long as an attribution to the original creator of the art is provided.

### Arttribute Non-commercial License

This license permits the use of art in AI-driven creative processes where the resultant output can be distributed or modified for non-commercial purposes only, as long as an attribution to the original creator of the art is provided.

### Arttribute Exclusive Non-commercial License

This license permits the use of art exclusively by any agreed number of parties in AI-driven creative processes. The resultant output can be distributed or modified for non-commercial purposes only, as long as an attribution is provided.
