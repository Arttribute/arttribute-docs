## Creating an Arttribute Payment

### Step 1: Obtain your API Key

To interact with the payment functionalities of the Arttribute platform, you'll first need an API key. This key authenticates your requests and allows access to the Arttribute's payment features. To get an API key, follow the steps in the [Generating Keys section](/guide/generate-keys).

### Step 2: Make a Payment

With your API key, you can initiate a payment on the Arttribute platform. Ensure you have the recipient's details, the amount, and other necessary payment attributes.
