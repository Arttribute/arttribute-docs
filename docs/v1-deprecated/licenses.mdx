# Licenses

## Overview

At Arttribute, we understand the importance of clarity and transparency when it comes to the rights and permissions associated with each piece of artwork. To this end, we are working on integrating a comprehensive licensing framework to ensure both artists and AI practitioners can confidently share and use artworks on our platform.

## License Development Status

We are currently in the process of developing and refining our licensing system, which includes the consideration of various Creative Commons licenses. Our goal is to provide a versatile yet straightforward licensing model that addresses the unique needs of our user base.

> **Note**: Until our new licensing framework is fully launched, we recommend using Creative Commons licence and Arttribute's permission requests to ensure mutual understanding regarding the usage rights of any artwork on Arttribute.

## Feedback and Participation

We value your insights and feedback. If you have suggestions or concerns about our upcoming licensing framework, or if you would like to be involved in its development, please reach out to [bashybaranaba@gmail.com ](mailto:bashybaranaba@gmail.com)
